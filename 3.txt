Rampant racism and crime. A financial culture that encourages the exploitation of anyone and everyone in sight,
all in the name of profit. Unequalled levels of violence for a country who's not at war. Political division that's so
strong, people are discussing civil war. Corporate lobbying and corruption of public officials.
Rejection of scientific conclusions in favour of making the rich even richer. The list goes on and on.
