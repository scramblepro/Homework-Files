Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a potential presidential contender, accused state authorities of responding slowly to the
attacks. Reeling off a list of terrorist incidents in recent years, Luzhkov said, "What measures did the state take?
No measures were taken. . . .
It was only after those terrible explosions in Moscow that our state authorities started realizing that some measures
must be taken." (c) W.P. https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/sept99/moscow17.htm
